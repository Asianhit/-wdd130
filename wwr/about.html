        <h3><strong>description</strong></h3>
        <p>Whitewater rafting is a type of recreation that involves navigating a non-motorized watercraft down free
            flowing rivers.
            A rafting company organizes trips, provides the watercraft, life jackets, etc., and typically offers
            experienced guides
            to take passengers down a river. The business intent is to provide a thrilling and safe experience to
            individuals and
            groups for a fee.
